This Arduino project uses a DFPlayer Mini module to play music stored on an SD card, with control over playback through Bluetooth communication with the HC-06 Bluetooth module and sensor-based volume adjustment with a potentiometer. The project was originally developed in 2021, and the code may need updates to work with current hardware and software versions.
